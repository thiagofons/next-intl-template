# NextJS Internationalization Template

A template you can use to build your own internationalized website in NextJS using `next-intl` with the App Router, including internationalized routing.

You can either `fork` this repository and start building your own, or use this repository as a template for building your repositories.

Don't forget to give it a ‚≠ê if you liked!

## How to contribute

Since it's an already-built template, you can share this with your developer community and others who have an interest in building multi-language websites.
